<h1>Other Projects</h1>
    <p>The pages listed below are projects that are works in progress.  They are not done yet, but will be soon.  I am using these to build my skill, and expertise.  
    </p>   
<h2>Work website:</h2>
    <p><a href="../pages/work.html" class="work">This</a>work in progress is for my work website.  The current website was built by our JMS (jail management system) provider.  It is not the best designed website, especially when it comes to mobile devices.   I want to redesign the website with a mobile first approach.  I plan on using bootstrap, which is a new tool that I have not used before.  
    Please be aware that this site is a standalone site, and there is no direct link back to the main website.  
    </p>
<h2>Lunch picker:</h2>     
    <p>This is another project that is geared towards work.  We tend to eat together, as a group.  The issue is that no one can ever decide what to eat for lunch.  This page takes a couple variables that the user selects, and returns a random restaurant.  This is based on JavaScript, and being written entirely by me.
