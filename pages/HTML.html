    <h1>WHAT IN THE WORLD IS HTML?</h1>
        <p>A website, like an onion, or <a href= "images\shrek.jpg" alt"picture of Shrek">Ogre</a>, has many levels.  The first of those levels is the HyperText MarkUp Language, or HTML level.  HTML is also referred to as the content level of a website, as it contains all the content of the website.  
        </p>
        <p>How does HTML work?
            As nice as it would be to simply copy, and past your word document, or pictures onto a website, it doesn’t really work that way.  HTML uses elements, indicated by tags, to tell the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.  Some example of tags would are:<br>
            &lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;<br>
            &lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;<br>
            &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;<br>
            &lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
            </p>
        <p>The &lt;h1&gt;, and &lt;h2&gt; tag indicate headings.  There are six heading tags, with one being the largest by default, and six the smallest.  <p> tags tell the browser the text in between is a paragraph, and to format it as such.  Without a &lt;p&gt; tag, all the text would be jumbled together.  The last example, &lt;a&gt; is how a <a href src"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink" target="blank">hyperlink</a> is placed on a website.  
        </p>
