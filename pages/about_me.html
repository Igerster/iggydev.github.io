    <h2>A little about me</h2>
            <p>My name is Nick.  Online, I go by Iggy. It’s a nickname I’ve had for many many years.  I am an aspiring web developer.  I currently work in law enforcement, at a county jail as a Lieutenant.  In my current capacities, I oversee officers who have direct contact with inmates, and lower level supervisors.  A large part of my job is writing policy and procedures for my department.  These policies must keep safety and security as top priority, as well as  being able to stand up to the scrutiny of the courts.  Before working in law enforcement, I worked at <a id="box" href="https://www.netflix.com" target="blank">Netflix</a> for 6 ½ years.  

            </p>    
            <p>I believe everyday is an opportunity.  It’s important to never stop learning, and passing on that knowledge.  I hope this site shows a bit of what I have learned in regards to web development.  If you would like to contact me for more information, please feel free to do so, at <a href="mailto:"igerster80@gmail.com">igerster80@gmail.com</a>
