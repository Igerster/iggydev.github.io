    <h2>A little about me</h2>
        <p>My name is Nick, but online I go by Iggy, or Igerster.  I am an aspiring web developer.  On this website, I hope to show you some of my skills and abilities when it comes to web development.  If you would like to contact me for more information, please feel free to do so.
        </p>    
        <p>I am currently working in Law Enforcement as a Lieutenant at a County Jail.  I have the responsibility of supervising the officers that are in direct contact with inmates, as well as lower level supervisors. My decisions have a direct impact on the safety and security of the facility, as well the lives of the staff that work there, and the inmates that are housed there.  In my time working for the jail, I have written, and implemented many new policy, and procedures.  These policies must ensure that our facility remains safe and secure, as well being able to stand up to the scrutiny of the courts.  
        </p>    
        <p>Before working in law enforcement, I worked for <a id="box" href="https://www.netflix.com" target="blank">Netflix</a> for 6 Â½ years.</p>
