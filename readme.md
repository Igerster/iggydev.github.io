Iggy’s Travel:
This site is a basic travel website with a packing list and a calculator to help with cost planning.  Features of the site are:
The site is built mobile first
There are a total of three media queries. 
Since I do not have every type of device, I used Chrome Developer Tools, and sized the windows to iPhone X for the phone, and iPad for the tablet. 
On the smallest of screens i.e. cell phones, there  is a “hamburger menu.”
On medium size screens, the hamburger menu changes to buttons aligned vertically.
The buttons are colored using “nth child”
On larger screens, the buttons change again, to traditional links across the top of the page.  
At the bottom of the home page, is a contact link.  It is responsive, and will not allow a user to click submit unless both forms are filled out.  
Please note, this form does not actually go anywhere as there are no server side services running.
The Packing List page uses JavaScript to take input from the user to add items to their list.  They can mark them off by clicking them, or remove them by clicking the “x.”  
Again there is no way to save this since there are no server side services for the site.
The Calculator page launches a calculator for the user.  Buttons were styled with “nth child.”  
The site is hosted at iggydev.net

Other projects:
There is a page titled “Other Projects.”  This is for projects that are in the very early stages.  One is a redesign of my work website.  The other is a random name generator, because people at work can never decide where to go for lunch.  Neither of these are done, and should not be considered as part of the project at this time, however feel free to look at them.  Please note that because they are works in progress, and separate for the project, they will not have a link back to the main page.
