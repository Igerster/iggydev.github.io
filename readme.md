Iggy’s Travel:

This is the final submission for my Code Louisville Front End project.  The project can be viewed here on Github, or it may viewed at iggydev.net. 

My site, is a basic website to help someone plan a vacation, with tools to figure out cost (calculator), and what they need to pack (packing list)

Features found on the site include:

Three (3) separate media queries, allowing for a mobile first design.  The page navigation changes from a “hamburger” menu, to buttons, to traditional links depending on the size of the screen.  

:nth-child is used to style both the buttons found in the middle media query, as well as the calculator buttons.  

On the Home page, there is a contact form.  This form requires user input, and will not allow the user to submit it without it being filled out.  This form does not currently save any information, since there is no server side functionality built into the site.  
There is another contact option on the about me page.  This will launch the users email app to allow them to send an email to me if they wish. 

On the Calculator page, a user may do functions that a basic calculator would do.  It takes the user input, displays what “buttons” they have selected, and the result.  This was built with JavaScript, and styled with CSS using :nth-child.

The Packing List page allows a user to input items that they want to take with them.  Clicking add will add them to their list below.  They can mark them off as they pack them.  They can also remove them by clicking the “X”.  This was built using JavaScript.  

All HTML, CSS, JS, and IMG files are in separate folders.  

On the Other Projects page are a couple unfinished projects.  They are not part of my project.  These are projects that I am intending to continue to work on after the completion of Code Louisville.
